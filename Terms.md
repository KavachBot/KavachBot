# 2. Terms of Service

These Terms of Service explain how you may use Kavach and what Kavach will (and will not) do. Keep these published on your website and link them during premium checkout and onboarding.

## 2.1 Acceptance

By inviting Kavach to your Discord server or using any of its services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, remove the bot and do not use its services.

## 2.2 Definitions

* "Kavach" means the software and services run by the Kavach team and offered under the kavachbot.com domain.
* "User" or "you" means the person or organization using the bot.
* "Server" means a Discord guild where Kavach is installed.

## 2.3 Services provided

Kavach provides bot-based security and moderation tools including AntiNuke, Automod, Moderation tools, Backups, Logs, Config, Verification workflows, JoinGate, and related services. Premium subscriptions add advanced features and priority support.

## 2.4 Required permissions and role placement

To operate correctly, Kavach must be placed high in the role hierarchy and be granted the permissions listed in Section 1. If the bot is not given required permissions, certain features will fail. You are responsible for assigning permissions.

## 2.5 Direct messaging

Kavach may send Direct Messages to users for verification, alerts, or incident reports. By using the bot you consent to receiving those messages. Kavach will not spam users. Critical security DMs may be mandatory.

## 2.6 Prohibited uses

You may not use Kavach to:

* Break Discord terms or local laws
* Perform harassment, hate, or abuse
* Redistribute the bot or its code without permission
* Bypass Discord rate limits or otherwise attempt to exploit the platform
  Failure to comply may result in access suspension or removal.

## 2.7 Modifications to service and terms

Kavach may change features or these Terms. Significant changes will be announced via the support server and email when possible. Continued use after changes means you accept the new Terms.

## 2.8 Termination

Kavach may suspend or terminate service for servers or users that violate these Terms. You may also remove the bot at any time.

## 2.9 Payment and premium subscriptions

Premium features may be billed via third-party payment processors. All purchases are subject to the Refund Policy. When you subscribe you agree to auto-renewal until you cancel.

## 2.10 Liability limitation

Kavach will make reasonable efforts to provide services, but cannot guarantee 100% uptime or that every threat will be stopped. Kavach and its owners are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Total liability is limited to the total fees paid to Kavach for services in the 12 months prior to the claim. This clause is limited where local law prevents it.

## 2.11 Governing law

These Terms are governed by the law applicable to Kavach's legal entity. For jurisdiction details contact [legal@kavachbot.com](mailto:legal@kavachbot.com).

**Note:** Kavach may send verified or security messages via Direct Message (DM). By using the bot, server members accept receiving required security DMs. Users can opt out of non-essential DMs where available, but critical alerts and verification steps may remain mandatory.
