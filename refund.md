# Refund Policy for Kavach Discord Bot

*Last Updated: 26 August 2025*

At **Kavach Bot**, we provide premium digital security and moderation services for Discord servers. Since these services are delivered digitally and activated instantly, our refund process has certain limitations.

## 1. Non-Refundable Services

* Once premium services or subscriptions are activated, they are considered delivered and are **non-refundable**.
* Since Kavach Bot provides automated features, there is no way to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù a service once enabled.

## 2. Eligible Refunds

Refunds may only be granted under the following circumstances:

* **Duplicate Payment:** If you were charged more than once for the same service.
* **Technical Failure:** If premium services fail to activate and our support team cannot resolve the issue.
* **Unauthorized Transaction:** If payment was made fraudulently without your knowledge, subject to investigation.

---

## 3. Refund Requests

* Refund requests must be submitted within **7 days of the original transaction**.
* You can raise a request by emailing us at **[support@kavachbot.com](mailto:support@kavachbot.com)** with payment proof and relevant details.

## 4. Processing Time

* Approved refunds will be processed within **5‚Äì10 business days**.
