# 1. Privacy Policy

This section details what we collect, why we collect it, how we store it, and how you can ask for changes.

## 1.1 What we collect

Kavach collects the minimal data required to operate on Discord servers:

* Server ID and name
* User IDs and usernames for moderation and verification purposes
* Role IDs and role names to manage permissions
* Audit events and moderation actions (who did what when)
* Backup snapshots of server structure (roles, channels, permissions)
* Payment and subscription status records (transaction id, plan, timestamps)

We do not collect or store payment card numbers. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors.

## 1.2 Why we collect data

* To operate AntiNuke, Moderation, Automod, and Verification flows
* To keep logs for auditing and appeals
* To provide backup and restore services
* To manage subscriptions and billing

## 1.3 How we store and protect data

* Data is stored on secured servers managed by the Kavach team.
* Backups and critical logs are stored encrypted at rest.
* All network traffic that contains private or sensitive information is encrypted in transit.
* Access to stored data is limited to authorized personnel.

## 1.4 Data retention

* Default retention for logs: 180 days.
* Default retention for backups: 90 days.
* Retention may be extended for Premium customers per plan.

## 1.5 Your rights

If you are a user on a server where Kavach runs, you may request:

* A copy of personal data stored about you
* Correction of inaccurate data
* Deletion of personal data (subject to legitimate interests, e.g., logs needed for ongoing investigations)
* Restriction of processing

To exercise these rights, contact [legal@kavachbot.com](mailto:legal@kavachbot.com). We will respond within 30 days where required by law.

## 1.6 Third-party services

We use external providers for payments and analytics. Those providers may collect additional data under their own policies. For payments, sensitive payment details are handled exclusively by the payment provider.

## 1.7 Children

Kavach is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child under the age of 13 provided personal data, contact [legal@kavachbot.com](mailto:legal@kavachbot.com).

Note: Kavach may send verified or security messages via Direct Message (DM). By using the bot, server members accept receiving required security DMs. Users can opt out of non-essential DMs where available, but critical alerts and verification steps may remain mandatory.
